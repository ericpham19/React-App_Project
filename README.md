 React-App_Project
 Hi there, thank you for stumbling upon this project I have created using React. This application focuses on the concept of cryptocurrency and it allows you to see data of the most trending coins of the day and the top 100 coins globally. There is also a calculator which you can use to see how much you may gain or lose from purchasing a coin using historical data.
 
 To start the application, please clone this repository. 
 Open up your cloned repository and open a terminal.
 Run "npm start" 
 A page should open in your browser or if not, you could access the application on "http://localhost:3000/"
 Thank you for trying out my application
